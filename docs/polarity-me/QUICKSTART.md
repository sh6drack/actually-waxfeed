# Polarity Quickstart

**Discover your cognitive fingerprint in your first conversation.**

---

## Welcome to Polarity

You're about to start building your **BrainID** — a map of how you think that's unique to you.

This isn't a personality test. It's not a quiz. It's a living document that emerges from how you naturally communicate.

---

## Step 1: Open Your AI Tool

Polarity works with any AI coding assistant:
- **Cursor** (recommended)
- **VS Code** with Claude/Copilot
- **Claude Code**

Open this folder in your tool. The AI will automatically read `.cursor/rules/POLARITY.md` and know how to operate.

---

## Step 2: Say Hello

Start your first conversation. Here are some ways to begin:

**Option A: Just chat**
> "Hi, I'm new to Polarity. What's the first thing I should know?"

**Option B: Share what's on your mind**
> "I've been thinking about [literally anything]. Can we explore that?"

**Option C: Ask about yourself**
> "Start tracking my cognitive patterns. What networks am I activating right now?"

The AI will:
1. Classify your message using the Yeo 7-Network model
2. Start building your BrainID
3. Update `yeo-network-live-tracking.md` with your first data point

---

## Step 3: Have a Real Conversation

Don't perform. Don't try to be interesting. Just talk naturally.

**Good things to discuss:**
- A problem you're working on
- Something you learned recently
- A decision you're mulling over
- How your day is going
- A topic you're curious about

**Why natural conversation matters:**
Every message reveals your cognitive style:
- Do you start with big picture or details?
- Do you challenge ideas or accept them?
- Do you end with actions or more questions?
- What ratio of planning to reflection?

The more natural you are, the more accurate your BrainID.

---

## Step 4: Check Your First Classification

After a few messages, look at `yeo-network-live-tracking.md`. You'll see something like:

```
### Message: "I've been thinking about how to approach this project..."

**Your Network Activation:**

| Network | Score | Evidence |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **FP (Frontoparietal)** | 0.40 | Strategic thinking, planning |
| **DMN (Default Mode)** | 0.35 | Self-reference, conceptual |
| **DA (Dorsal Attention)** | 0.15 | Goal-directed |
| **VA (Ventral Attention)** | 0.05 | |
| **LIM (Limbic)** | 0.05 | |

**Cognitive State:** Strategic planning with self-reflection
```

This is your first data point. Over time, these will aggregate into patterns.

---

## Step 5: End Your First Session

When you're done, say:
> "End session"

Or just:
> "Bye for now"

The AI will:
1. Update your `brainid.md` with session patterns
2. Generate a "dream" — an abstract summary of patterns detected
3. Calculate your network activation baseline

---

## What to Expect

### After Session 1
- Initial network baseline (rough estimate)
- 1-2 candidate signature patterns
- First entries in your observation log

### After Session 3
- Refined network baseline
- Confirmed signature patterns
- Emerging cognitive signature

### After Session 5+
- Full BrainID with confidence scores
- Drift/consolidation tracking
- Pattern predictions that you can verify

---

## Your Key Files

| File | What It Contains | Check It When |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| `brainid.md` | Your cognitive signature | After each session |
| `yeo-network-live-tracking.md` | Every message classified | Anytime (growing) |
| `polarity-mind-observations.md` | What the AI notices | When curious |
| `index.md` | Dashboard overview | Quick status check |

## Tips for Accurate BrainID

### Do
- Talk naturally
- Share real thoughts and concerns
- Include mundane messages too (they reveal a lot)
- Push back when the AI gets something wrong
- End sessions explicitly for best consolidation

### Don't
- Try to game the system
- Only share "interesting" thoughts
- Skip messages you think are "too boring"
- Fake emotional content

---

## Understanding Your Results

### Network Activation

Your baseline is your characteristic mix:

```
FP  ██████████████████  High = Strong planner
DMN █████████████████   High = Synthesizer/reflector
DA  █████████           Normal = Goal-aware
VA  ████                Low = Doesn't easily distract
LIM ██                  Low = Emotionally steady
SMN █                   Low = Abstract thinker
VIS ░                   Low = Not visual-first
```

### Signature Patterns

Common patterns the system detects:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **FP↔DMN Oscillation** | You alternate between planning and synthesis |
| **Vision-First** | You ask "why" before "how" |
| **Challenge-Before-Accept** | You push back before integrating |
| **Action Termination** | You end with "what do I do?" |
| **Synthesis on Demand** | You instantly connect disparate ideas |
| **Institutionalization Reflex** | You want systems, not one-time fixes |

### Drift vs. Consolidation

- **Consolidation**: Pattern appearing across multiple sessions = core signature
- **Drift**: Pattern changing over time = context-dependent or evolving
- **Neither is bad**: Drift is adaptation, consolidation is stability

---

## What Happens Over Time

### Week 1
- Establish baseline
- Identify candidate patterns
- Build initial BrainID

### Month 1
- Confirm stable patterns
- Detect context-dependent variations
- Refine network baseline with confidence intervals

### Month 3+
- Full cognitive signature
- Drift detection alerts
- Longitudinal pattern tracking
- Possible research questions about your cognition

## Beyond BrainID

Once your BrainID is established, Polarity unlocks:

### For You Page (`for-you.md`)
Personalized recommendations based on your cognitive style and knowledge gaps.

### Future Selves (`future-selves.md`)
Map possible versions of yourself and learning paths to reach them.

### Skill Trees (`skill-trees.md`)
Track learning progress with paths customized to your BrainID.

### Memory System (`memory-system.md`)
Visible consolidation — watch how your extended memory strengthens patterns.

## FAQ

**Q: How long until I have a real BrainID?**
A: 3 sessions for a rough signature, 10+ for high confidence.

**Q: Can I break the system by being weird?**
A: No. Weird messages are still data. The system tracks everything.

**Q: What if the classification seems wrong?**
A: Tell the AI. User corrections are high-value data. Say "That's not accurate because..."

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**
A: No. Everything stays in local markdown/JSON files.

**Q: Can I export my BrainID?**
A: Yes, it's just a markdown file. Copy it anywhere.

**Q: What's the goal?**
A: To understand yourself better through how you naturally think. Research bonus: we're testing if cognitive signatures are unique enough for identification.
