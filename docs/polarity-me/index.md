## Memory System Status

**`memory-system.md`** — Consolidation tracking and dreams

### Memory Architecture:

```
Working Memory    → yeo-network-live-tracking.md
                    └─→ INFORMS all other layers

Episodic Memory   → polarity-mind-observations.md
                  → digests/*.md

Semantic Memory   → data/*.json
                  → for-you.md

Prospective Memory → future-selves.md → skill-trees.md

Pattern Memory    → brainid.md (your signature)
                  → memory-system.md (consolidation)

Procedural Memory → SYSTEM-RULES.md (how this works)

Archive           → archive/sessions/
```

**Latest Dream:** [None yet — dreams generate at session end]

## System Rules

**`SYSTEM-RULES.md`** — Operating rules for the AI

**Core Principles:**
- Every message gets classified (no exceptions)
- Updates cascade across layers
- BrainID is the priority
- User corrections are gold

**Update Tiers:**

| Tier | File | When |
|------|------|------|
| Always | `yeo-network-live-tracking.md` | Every message |
| Per-session | `brainid.md`, `memory-system.md` | Session end |
| Per-insight | `polarity-mind-observations.md` | When realizations emerge |
| Per-data | `data/*.json` | When new info appears |
| Per-interest | `for-you.md` | New interests discovered |
| Per-learning | `future-selves.md`, `skill-trees.md` | Learning happens |

## BrainID ↔ TasteID Integration

**`BRAINID-TASTEID-INTEGRATION.md`** — Cross-domain cognitive modeling

Polarity powers both:
- **BrainID** — How you think (cognitive signature)
- **TasteID** — How you listen (WaxFeed music signature)

**The Flywheel:**
1. Music reviews calibrate cognitive classification
2. Cognitive state informs music recommendations
3. Cross-domain patterns reveal deeper identity

**Correlations to Track:**
| Cognitive Mode | Music Mode |
|---------------|------------|
| FP (Planning) | Discovery |
| DMN (Reflective) | Comfort |
| LIM (Emotional) | Emotion |
| DA (Focused) | Depth |

> *See full integration design in BRAINID-TASTEID-INTEGRATION.md*

## How to Use Polarity

**Just chat with the AI!** Say things like:

### To Build Your BrainID:
- "Let's start building my cognitive profile"
- "Analyze how I've been thinking in this conversation"

### To Track Life Data:
- "Add a contact: [name], [email], [notes]"
- "I have a meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
- "Add a todo: [task]"

### To Learn:
- "Teach me about [topic]"
- "What should I learn next?"

### To Get Recommendations:
- "What perspectives am I missing?"
- "What should I read?"

### To Reflect:
- "What patterns have you noticed about me?"
- "How am I doing on [goal]?"

All files update automatically and stay in sync.
