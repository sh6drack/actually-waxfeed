## Perspective Gaps

*Here's what I think you're missing—fields and frameworks that would give you fuller perspective. These aren't weaknesses; they're opportunities.*

### How I Identify Gaps

As I learn about your knowledge constellation, I look for:

2. **Critiques** of your current views
3. **Different traditions** from your defaults
4. **Skills** you need but don't have
5. **History** of fields you work in

*Gaps will be identified as we converse.*
