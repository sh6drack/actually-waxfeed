# BrainID: Your Cognitive Signature

*Tracking your unique cognitive patterns over time — how they consolidate, how they drift, and what causes the changes.*

**Created:** [Auto-populated on first session]  
**Last Updated:** [Auto-populated]  
**Sessions Tracked:** 0

## The Goal

**BrainID should be able to identify who you are from anyone else in the world.**

Like a fingerprint, but cognitive. The hypothesis: Your signature patterns (HOW you think) are unique enough to distinguish you from any other person talking to the same AI.

### Research Questions

1. **How unique are signature patterns?** Can we identify you from your cognitive oscillation alone?
2. **What's the minimum data needed?** How many messages before we can identify someone?
3. **What patterns are most discriminating?** Which signatures vary most between people?
4. **Are there "cognitive twins"?** People with nearly identical signatures?

---

## Core Signature (Current)

Your BrainID is the characteristic pattern of how you think — not WHAT you think, but HOW.

### Network Activation Baseline

*This section populates after your first session.*

```
                    YOUR BASELINE           TYPICAL RANGE (ESTIMATED)
DMN (Default Mode)     ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [15-25%]
FP (Frontoparietal)    ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [20-30%]
DA (Dorsal Attention)  ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [15-25%]
VA (Ventral Attention) ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [10-20%]
LIM (Limbic)           ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [10-20%]
SMN (Somatomotor)      ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [5-15%]
VIS (Visual)           ░░░░░░░░░░░░  ??%    [5-15%]
```

### How Is "Typical Range" Identified?

**Honest answer:** These ranges are ESTIMATES based on:
- General neuroscience literature on resting-state network activation
- Intuitions about conversation-based text (more DMN/FP than resting state)
- NOT from actual population data through this specific method

**What we'd need to establish real baselines:**
1. **Collect data from many users** — Run same classification on 100+ people
2. **Calculate population distributions** — Mean, standard deviation per network
3. **Define "typical" statistically** — e.g., within 1 SD of mean
4. **Control for context** — Different tasks/topics may shift baselines

## Signature Patterns

*Patterns will be added here as they're detected across sessions.*

### Pattern Template

**Pattern X: [Name]**  
**Description:** [What the pattern is]  
**Evidence:**
- [Specific examples from conversation]

**Confidence:** [Low/Medium/High]  
**Stability:** TBD (need more sessions)

## Session Log

*Each session gets logged here with network trajectory and patterns observed.*

### Session 1: [Date]

*Your first session will be logged here automatically.*

## Consolidation Factors

### The Hypothesis

The same underlying factors that consolidate MEMORIES may predict which cognitive PATTERNS persist.

| Factor | Memory Version | Pattern Version | Same Mechanism? |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Repetition** | Repeated experiences consolidate | Patterns across sessions strengthen | Likely yes |
| **Emotional charge** | Emotional memories persist | Patterns during high engagement strengthen | Maybe |
| **Connection** | Linked memories persist | Patterns linked to identity persist | Likely yes |
| **Novelty** | Novel events get encoded | Novel patterns get attention | Likely yes |
| **Personal relevance** | Self-relevant memories persist | Goal-aligned patterns strengthen | Maybe |

### What We Need to Test

1. Do patterns that appear repeatedly actually strengthen? (Track over sessions)
2. Do patterns during emotional moments persist more? (Correlate LIM spikes with pattern stability)
3. Do identity-connected patterns drift less? (Compare core vs. peripheral patterns)

---

## Drift Detection

### What Would Indicate Drift?

| Pattern | Drift Signal | Possible Cause |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| FP↔DMN Oscillation | Sustained single-network dominance | Stress, fatigue, hyperfocus |
| Synthesis on Demand | Failure to connect presented domains | Cognitive load, unfamiliarity |
| Vision-First | Jumping to details without "why" | Time pressure, familiar territory |
| Action Termination | Extended theory without action ask | Exploration mode, low urgency |
| Challenge-Before-Accept | Accepting claims without pushback | Trust established, fatigue |

### What Would Indicate Consolidation?

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Pattern appears in 5+ consecutive sessions | Core signature |
| Pattern appears across different topics | Domain-independent |
| Pattern strength increases over time | Strengthening |
| Pattern appears automatically (unprompted) | Automatized |

## Longitudinal Tracking

### Pattern Strength Over Time

*To be updated each session*

| Pattern | Session 1 | Session 2 | Session 3 | Session 4 | Session 5 | Trend |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| [Pattern 1] | | | | | | |
| [Pattern 2] | | | | | | |
| [Pattern 3] | | | | | | |

### Network Baseline Over Time

*To be updated each session*

| Network | Session 1 | Session 2 | Session 3 | Trend |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| DMN | | | | |
| FP | | | | |
| DA | | | | |
| VA | | | | |
| LIM | | | | |
| SMN | | | | |
| VIS | | | | |

## What Could Cause Changes?

### External Factors
- **Sleep:** Poor sleep → lower FP, higher emotional reactivity
- **Stress:** High stress → sustained FP (hypervigilance) or LIM spike
- **Time pressure:** → Skip vision-first, jump to action
- **Social context:** → Different patterns with different people
- **Topic familiarity:** → Less synthesis needed in known domains

### Internal Factors
- **Skill development:** → Patterns in learning domains shift as mastery grows
- **Identity shifts:** → Core patterns may drift during life transitions
- **Goal changes:** → Action-termination targets shift

### Tracking These

When you notice a drift, ask:
1. What's different externally? (sleep, stress, context)
2. What's different internally? (goals, mood, energy)
3. Is this drift or appropriate adaptation?

---

## Research Questions

1. **Are signature patterns stable across years?** (Longitudinal BrainID study)
2. **Do signature patterns predict task performance?** (Correlation study)
3. **Can we detect cognitive drift before it's noticeable?** (Early warning system)
4. **What interventions stabilize desirable patterns?** (Applied question)

These are publishable research questions.
