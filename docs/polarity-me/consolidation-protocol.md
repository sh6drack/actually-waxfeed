# Polarity Consolidation Protocol

*Like sleep for your extended mind — reviewing, connecting, cleaning up.*

---

## The Problem

As we add files, the system grows. Without consolidation:
- Files accumulate without connection
- Redundant information across files
- Old information becomes stale
- Structure doesn't match current thinking
- Finding things gets harder

This is the "LEGO bricks on the floor" problem.

## Consolidation Schedule

### Daily (End of Session)
- [ ] Update `brainid.md` with session patterns
- [ ] Ensure all messages classified in `yeo-network-live-tracking.md`
- [ ] Log realizations to `polarity-mind-observations.md`

### Weekly (Sunday Review)
- [ ] Review `data/todos.json` — complete, cancel, or update stale items
- [ ] Check `for-you.md` recommendations — any engaged? any to remove?
- [ ] Merge related insights in `polarity-mind-observations.md`
- [ ] Archive completed items

### Monthly (First of Month)
- [ ] Full file audit — what's active, what's archive?
- [ ] Update `index.md` to reflect current priorities
- [ ] Review `brainid.md` — are patterns consolidating or drifting?
- [ ] Archive old session data from `yeo-network-live-tracking.md`
- [ ] Update `for-you.md` knowledge constellation

## File Cleanup Rules

### When to Merge
- Two files cover similar ground → Merge into one
- Information is redundant → Consolidate to authoritative source
- File is referenced from multiple places → Consider if it should be split

### When to Archive
- File hasn't been referenced in 30+ days
- Information is superseded by newer file
- Project is complete

### When to Delete
- File is fully redundant (all info exists elsewhere)
- File was a temporary note
- Information is no longer relevant

### Archive Structure
```
/archive/
  /sessions/
    [session logs by date]
  /[YYYY-MM]/
    [dated archived files]
  /completed/
    [finished projects]
```

## Consolidation as Memory

From cognitive science:
- Memories consolidate when patterns keep influencing new moments
- Consolidation happens during sleep (review, prune, strengthen)
- Without consolidation, memories fade or become inaccessible

**Polarity parallel:**
- Files consolidate when they keep getting referenced
- Consolidation needs active review (the weekly/monthly protocol)
- Without consolidation, files become noise

---

## Implementation

**For now:** Manual consolidation following this protocol.

**For Polarity at scale:** Automatic consolidation
- Track file access patterns
- Suggest merges/archives
- Auto-summarize old sessions
- Surface stale information for review

## Modeling Sleep in Polarity

**Why sleep works (for biological memory):**
- No new input to process
- Full resources for internal processing
- Pattern replay at 5-20x compression
- Different neurochemistry enables plasticity

**How Polarity can have "sleep":**

| Sleep Function | Polarity Implementation |
|----------------|------------------------|
| No new input | Scheduled offline processing (session end) |
| Replay | Review recent conversations |
| Compression | Extract patterns from verbose content |
| Consolidation | Strengthen high-access items |
| Integration | Find cross-session connections |
| Forgetting | Archive low-importance items |
| Dreams | Generate abstract pattern summaries |

**Polarity "Dream" Feature:**

Generates abstract pattern representation at session end:
> "Patterns strengthened: [list]. New connections: [list]. Fading: [list]."

This makes consolidation VISIBLE — something biological memory doesn't do.
